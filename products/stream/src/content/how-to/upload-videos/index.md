# Upload videos

Stream provides four ways to upload videos to cover different use cases. 

After you upload a video, you must wait for the video to finish processing before you can stream it. Refer to [Processing notifications](/how-to/use-webhooks) to learn how to use webhooks to notify your service when a video is ready to stream.

| [Upload via link](/uploading-videos/upload-via-link) | The video library is stored in a cloud storage bucket. |
| [Direct creator uploads](/uploading-videos/direct-creator-uploads) | The end user is uploading videos but does not have access to your API tokens. For example, users are uploading content to your website or mobile app. |
